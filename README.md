Penn Course API Client for Python
====

This module is a thin Python wrapper for the Penn registrar API that provides basic convenience
functions for consuming all three API endpoints.


Getting an API key
----

To use this library, you must first obtain an API token and password, which can be done
[here](https://secure.www.upenn.edu/computing/da/webloginportal/eforms/index.html?content=kew/EDocLite?edlName=registrarApiAccessForm&userAction=initiate).

Documentation
----

The full API documentation can be found [here](https://esb.isc-seo.upenn.edu/8091/documentation/).
Documentation for the wrapper can be found at http://penn-sdk.readthedocs.org/

Running Tests
----

Once you have an API token and password, you can run the tests by creating a `tests/credentials.py`
file with them as constants:

```
USERNAME = 'MY_USERNAME'
PASSWORD = 'MY_PASSWORD'
```

Then run `python tests/registrar_tests.py`.
